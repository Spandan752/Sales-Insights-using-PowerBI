# Sales-Insights-using-PowerBI

In this project, I have developed an interactive dashboard using PowerBI Desktop and SQL for data loading and cleaning purpose. 
A sample dataset is created for sales record of a company and it is tested for several parameters to find sales region-wise.

Here, I have used 
**MySQL** - For creating the database and firing several queries for preprocessing.
**PowerBI** - For generating interactive dashboard, publish it and also share over mobile platform.
